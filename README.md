The DriverPass project was about helping a pretend client who wanted a system for students learning to drive. The client needed a website where users could sign up, take practice tests, schedule lessons, and track their progress. My job was to understand what the client wanted and design a system that could do all those things.

One thing I did well was turning the clientâ€™s needs into clear, organized steps. I made diagrams and documents that showed how the system would work for both students and admins.

If I could change one part of my work, I would make the sequence diagrams easier to read. I would also add more details about the tools and technology used in the system.

To understand what the client needed, I looked closely at the project instructions and wrote stories showing how people would use the system. I used those stories to design the features. It's important to think about what users need so the system is easy to use and solves the right problem.

When I design software, I start by learning what the user wants. Then I make diagrams like use case, class, and sequence diagrams to plan it out. In the future, I want to ask for more feedback and make changes earlier to improve my designs.
